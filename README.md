This is my implementation in JavaScript of the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, I've built a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.
